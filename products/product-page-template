    Around the world, the sport of Combat Robotics is popular and growing. This
    is particularly true for the 150-gram, 1-pound, and 3-pound weight
    classes, with over 6500 fights in the last two years. Despite the
    popularity, the controls system used to wirelessly control robots was designed
    decades ago for RC aircraft, and today is seriously outdated and expensive.
    The Battleblue is a lightweight and inexpensive Bluetooth-based robot control system.<br/><br/>
